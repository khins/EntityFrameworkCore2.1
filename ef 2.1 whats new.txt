		we can use anonymous types to seed data whose business logic or database autogenerates values, and we can even seed owned types
		The most common thing you might do with HasData is to let migrations use it to build SQL that will seed your database when you execute the migrations.
		But because EnsureCreated will use HasData at runtime, it allows you to use it as an alternative way to seed the InMemory provider when testing.
		 Remember that HasData is a convenience, but it's not meant to be a silver bullet for all of your seeding needs, and there is likely to still
		 be many scenarios that seeding with straightforward EF Core code using DbSets and calling SaveChanges is still going to be a better solution
